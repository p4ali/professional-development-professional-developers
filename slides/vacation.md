### Vacation: Use it (if you have it)!


Note:

Somehow we've forgotten how to use our vacation days. We seem to think the best workers can't take time away.

Being on all the time is one of the WORST things you can do.

If you don't like to travel (or don't want to spend the money), take a staycation. Find things to do around your home, as long as you're unplugged from work.

Employers who discourage using vacation are employers who don't value you as a person.
