## 5. Keep Track of your Ideas


Note:

Ideas can come at the most inopportune times, including during long meetings

Tools like Evernote are a huge lifesaver, but also keep a notepad in your laptop bag, your car, by your bed

Periodically go through your ideas; you might be surprised what you've captured!
