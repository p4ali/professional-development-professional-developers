## Code Speaks Louder Than Words

### Ship or Get Off the Pot <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


Note:

Read all you want, but real developers ship code.

Don't be afraid of making mistakes (you will), get your code out there and collect feedback.

Provide feedback to other projects. Report issues, help them get better.
