## Open-source FTW!


Note:

Open-source software is the reason I'm able to do what I'm doing today (a lot of WordPress, deployed on Linux servers)

OSS is also how I've made some of my strongest friendships and industry connections. It's sent me to the White House (twice) and given me the opportunity to collaborate with people I'd have been afraid to talk to beforehand

Not a money-maker for me – $15 total – but has helped me land my last two jobs.
