## 6. Leverage Open-source


Note:

Open-source software is the reason I'm able to do what I'm doing today (a lot of WordPress, deployed on Linux servers).

Not directly a money maker for me – $15 total – but has been directly responsible in helping me land my last two jobs. It's also sent me to the White House (twice) and introduced me to awesome people in the community.

Find ways to get involved in open source, even if just occasionally. The learning opportunities and connections are far too plentiful to pass up, and you'll help make your mark on the world.
