### Find and/or Become a Mentor!

[php-mentoring.org](http://php-mentoring.org/)


Note:

I've been lucky enough to have great mentors throughout my career, but never really paid it back.

Recently I signed up for PHP Mentoring, and am currently helping three developers in three separate countries (and timezones) step up their careers.

It's free to sign up, and you can find yourself a mentor and/or volunteer to mentor others.
