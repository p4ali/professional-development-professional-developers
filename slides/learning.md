## 8. Never Stop Learning


Note:

The only way we can continue to improve is by continuing to challenge ourselves.

Even if your projects are similar, try to do something better on each one.

Make it better. Harder. Stronger. Faster. Try a new library or technique.

Play with different languages, see what makes them tick. Build something from scratch, if only to figure out how.
